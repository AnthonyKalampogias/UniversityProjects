# Question Manager

## by Antonios Kalampogias

This application in C# is a simulation for Teachers/Examiners and Professors to help them in creating exam sheets for their students.



### Note, the application stores the questions in a MS access Database

Here a user through the application has the ability to

- Add a new question to the database

  This can consist of 

  - The correct answer along with 3 random ones
  - The difficulty level of the question
  - And a comment if the user wants to

- Delete a Question based on its ID

- Create an Exam Sheet based on the total amount that the user provides

The Application also consists of a simple UI at the bottom that displays all the available question in the database.
